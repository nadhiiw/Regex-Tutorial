# Regex-Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will be taking a brief look into what Regex (regular expressions) are and how they work. While regular expressions may seem to be overwhelming at first glance,
just like with any language, they can be broken down into its most simple parts and easily understood.

## Summary

Regex (short for regular expression) is a string of text that allows you to create search patterns that match, manage, and locate text. An example code snippet of regex shows as following:
```
/[\w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-z]{2,4}/
```
* A regular expression used to match an e-mail address

Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and within text-editors to find text within a file.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are characters within the regular expression that allow the user to match strings that begin with or ends with (or both) certain characters. 

Examples of Anchors are as follows:

* `^` - matches any string that start with the anterior word
* `$` - matches a string that end with preceeding word before the character
* Examples:
```
^Hello          matches any string starting with `Hello`
World$          matches any string ending with `World`
^Hello World$   matches exact string
goodbye         matches any string that has the exact text `goodbye` in it
```

### Quantifiers
Qunatifiers are characters within the regular expression that specify how many instances a character, group, or character class must be represented in the input to be matched.

Examples of Quanitifers are as follows:

* `*` - matches a string that has the anterior followed by zero or more of the last character
* `+` - matches a string that has the anterior followed by one or more of the last character
* `?` - matches a string that has the atnerior follwoed by zero or one of the last character
* `{}` -  matches a string that has the anterior followed by how ever many the number in the brackets of the last character in the string
* `()*` - matches a string that has any anterior characters followed by zero or more copies of the string within the brackets
* Examples:
```
xyz*        matches a string that has xy followed by zero or more z
xyz+        matches a string that has xy followed by one or more z
xyz?        matches a string that has xy followed by zero or one z
xyz{2}      matches a string that has xy followed by 2 z
xyz{2,}     matches a string that has xy followed by 2 or more z
xyz{2,5}    matches a string that has xy followed by 2 up to 5 z
x(yz)*      matches a string that has x followed by zero or more copies of the sequence yz
x(yz){2,5}  matches a string that has x followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence yz
```

### OR Operator
OR Operators (Alternation Operator) matches on of a choice of regular expressions: if you put the character(s) representing the alternation operator between any two characters in the regular expression, the result matches the union of the strings that those two characters match.

Examples of OR Operators are as follows:

* `(|)` - matches a string that has any anterior characters followed by the characters on the left or right of the vertical bar
* `[]` - matches a string that has any anterior characters without any characters within the brackets
* Examples: 
```
x(y|z)  matches a string that has x followed by y or z (and captures y or z)
x[yz]   matches a string that has x, but without capturing b or c
```
