# Regex-Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will be taking a brief look into what Regex (regular expressions) are and how they work. While regular expressions may seem to be overwhelming at first glance,
just like with any language, they can be broken down into its most simple parts and easily understood.

## Summary

Regex (short for regular expression) is a string of text that allows you to create search patterns that match, manage, and locate text. An example code snippet of regex shows as following:
```
/[\w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-z]{2,4}/
```
* A regular expression used to match an e-mail address

Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and within text-editors to find text within a file.
